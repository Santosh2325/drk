					 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.R.KAKADE College of Commerce  is one of the  leading commerce and management colleges, affiliated to the prestigious  University of Pune. Today, there are over 500 students and each  year the institution grows from strength to strength.<br>
The College has achieved excellent academic standards, while  simultaneously creating opportunities for the all round development of students  through sports and cultural activities by transferring the responsibility of  the learning to the learner. The College empowers students and fosters young  leaders. It has the highest number of students pursuing Chartered Accountancy  with B.Com. The college has obtained 100% results at the undergraduate level  and excelled in extra-curricular activities.<br>
D.R.KAKADE College was awarded the <strong>'Best College' by the University Pune for 2010-2011</strong>. The  institution was recognized for its leadership potential, its teaching  excellence, its innovative learner-centric approach and its strong  international linkages. It was the first college in Maharashtra to be  accredited 'A' grade with a score of 87.95% by the NAAC (National Assessment  &amp; Accreditation Council) in 2002. In 2008, HR College was awarded an 'A'  Grade by NAAC once again; with a CGPA of 3.46. <strong>In Jan 2013 the college underwent a third accreditation process with  NAAC awarding H.R. College of Commerce &amp; Economics with a CGPA of 3.72 on a  scale of 4, the highest CGPA in India under the revised scheme; and the highest  score in Maharashtra till March 23, 2013.</strong><br>
D.R.KAKADE College also has the unique distinction of having  received autonomy in 2007 from the University Grants Commission (UGC), making  it the first college in the 150-year history of the University of Mumbai to  have achieved this feat. The College will implement autonomy in due course.<br>
The college strives for excellence in teaching and learning  at undergraduate / postgraduate levels. In 1994, the college introduced the  UGC's Scheme of Vocationalisation with Advertising, Sales Promotion &amp; Sales  Management, Tourism &amp; Travel Management, Tax Procedure &amp; Practice and  Principles &amp; Practices of Insurance.<br>
The college was first to introduce an Honours' Programme  whereby along with the undergraduate program a student can earn honours credits  as well. The conventional Bachelor of Commerce continues to be the core of HR  College's educational framework but the College has subsequently expanded to  introduce other specialised courses in B.Com. The following degrees are offered  by the college:</p><ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
  <ul>
    <li>Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.)</li>
    <li>Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS)</li>
    <li>Bachelor of Commerce - Accounting and Finance  (BAF)</li>
    <li>Bachelor of Commerce - Banking and Insurance  (BBI)</li>
    <li>Bachelor of Commerce - Financial Markets (BFM)</li>
    <li>Bachelor in Mass Media (BMM)</li>
    <li>Masters of Commerce in Business Management</li>
    <li>Masters of Commerce in Accountancy</li>
    <li>PhD Program</li>
  </ul>
</ul><p>Greater academic rigor was built in for students pursuing  Honors programme by adding social and community service projects into the  credit earning requirements. Several new enrichment programmes were added to  the ones already taught at the college. The curriculum for additional  certificate programs was sent for endorsement to industry experts to ensure  that it met the industry needs. <br>
  Being at the hub of the business district, H.R. was the  first college in Mumbai to initiate strong industry-academia relations.  Industry experts are regularly invited to come and share their business  strategies and experiences. This interaction helps the students to keep abreast  with the latest developments in the business sector which in turn equips them  for their professional lives. Each year the best names in the corporate sector  offer H.R. students internships and placements.<br>
  Internationalisation has become the focal point of the  teaching learning process at H.R. The college leads the way in student and  faculty exchange programs. This exposure helps the faculty to understand the  best practices of leading institutions and incorporate them in their teaching  methods. The students are offered scholarships and exchange programs from  institutions like NYU Stern , USA and King's College, UK, which helps them gain  a global perspective.<br>
  The institution has a very active alumni association. Some  of our illustrious alumni who have excelled in all walks of life are: Kumar  Mangalam Birla, Prashant and Anshuman Ruia, Gautam Singhania, Karan Johar, Anil  Kamath, Luis Miranda, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Sunil Shetty, Aftaab Shivdasani, and  Raj Mirchandani. Dr. Indu Shahani is also a proud alumnus of H.R. College.<br>
  We look forward to H.R. becoming synonymous with 'High Rankers'  and its students with 'Higher Responsibility'. H.R.'s motto is 'Prosperity  through Commerce' and the institution will continue to produce young leaders of  high integrity, in the process fostering truly global citizens.<br>
  With Dr. Momin as Principal and a dedicated faculty,  the college looks forward to the growth of all its courses old and new</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
